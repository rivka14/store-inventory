# Full-Stack Store Inventory Management System

## Role & Context
You are a Senior Full-Stack Engineer. Develop a production-ready Inventory Management System. This is a real product—not a coding exercise. Prioritize clean architecture, maintainability, and professional code quality.

## Phase 0: Planning (CRITICAL)
**Do NOT start coding.** First, provide a detailed plan and wait for approval:
1. Project Structure: Complete monorepo tree view
2. Implementation Roadmap: Step-by-step sprint plan
3. Clarifying Questions: Any ambiguities identified

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- React Router v6, Zustand (global state), TanStack Query (server state)
- React Hook Form + Yup validation
- Vitest + React Testing Library

### Backend
- Node.js + Express (JavaScript)
- express-validator, Helmet, CORS, Morgan
- Jest + Supertest

### DevOps
- concurrently (single `npm run dev` command)
- Ports: Client 5173, Server 3001

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Inventory Page (`/`) - Main Dashboard
**UI Layout:**
- Top row: Product dropdown | Quantity input | [+] button
- Below dropdown: "new product" link → navigates to `/products`
- Items list: Shows all inventory items (name + quantity), each with delete option
- Bottom: [Save] button

**Features:**
- View all inventory items (name + quantity)
- Add item: Select from products dropdown, enter quantity (positive integer)
- Remove individual items from list
- Save: Sends entire inventory to server (POST /inventory)
- Reset: Clear all inventory (POST /inventory/reset)

**UX:** Loading states, toast notifications for success/error

### 2. Products Page (`/products`) - Full CRUD
**UI Layout:**
- Input field: Product name + [Save] button (for new products)
- Products list: All products with Edit/Delete actions
- Visual indicator for products currently in inventory

**Features:**
- **Create**: Add new product (unique name, required)
- **Read**: Display all products
- **Update**: Edit product name (inline or modal)
- **Delete**: Remove product (only if NOT in current inventory)

| DELETE | `/product/:name` | Delete product (if not in inventory) |

### Inventory
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/inventory` | Get current inventory |
| POST | `/inventory` | Replace entire inventory |

## Architecture Requirements

### Backend (Layered)
```

├── src/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── repositories/    # In-memory, DB-ready pattern
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── app.js
└── tests/
```

### Frontend
```

## Quality Standards

- **Testing**: Backend >80%, Frontend >70% on critical paths
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any`
- **UX**: Loading states, toasts, form validation
- **Code**: ESLint + Prettier, DRY, SOLID

---

## Deliverables

1. Source Code: `/client` + `/server` monorepo
2. README.md: Setup and run instructions
3. ARCHITECTURE.md: Design decisions and patterns
4. Single command: `npm run dev`
